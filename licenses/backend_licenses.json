In order  to make  this project\nusable to  a vast majority of  developers, we distribute it  under two\nmutually exclusive open-source licenses.\n\nThis means that *you* must choose  *one* of the two licenses described\nbelow, then obey all its terms and conditions when using FreeType 2 in\nany of your projects or products.\n\n  - The FreeType License,  found in the file  `docs/FTL.TXT`, which is\n    similar to the  original BSD license *with*  an advertising clause\n    that forces  you to explicitly  cite the FreeType project  in your\n    product's  documentation.  All  details are  in the  license file.\n    This license is suited to products which don't use the GNU General\n    Public License.\n\n    Note that  this license  is compatible to  the GNU  General Public\n    License version 3, but not version 2.\n\n  - The   GNU   General   Public   License   version   2,   found   in\n    `docs/GPLv2.TXT`  (any  later  version  can  be  used  also),  for\n    programs  which  already  use  the  GPL.  Note  that  the  FTL  is\n    incompatible with GPLv2 due to its advertisement clause.\n\nThe contributed  BDF and PCF  drivers come  with a license  similar to\nthat  of the  X Window  System.   It is  compatible to  the above  two\nlicenses (see files `src/bdf/README`  and `src/pcf/README`).  The same\nholds   for   the   source    code   files   `src/base/fthash.c`   and\n`include/freetype/internal/fthash.h`; they were part of the BDF driver\nin earlier FreeType versions.\n\nThe gzip  module uses the  zlib license (see  `src/gzip/zlib.h`) which\ntoo is compatible to the above two licenses.\n\nThe files `src/autofit/ft-hb.c` and `src/autofit/ft-hb.h` contain code\ntaken almost  verbatim from the  HarfBuzz file `hb-ft.cc`,  which uses\nthe 'Old MIT' license, compatible to the above two licenses.\n\nThe  MD5 checksum  support  (only used  for  debugging in  development\nbuilds) is in the public domain.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                    The FreeType Project LICENSE\n                    ----------------------------\n\n                            2006-Jan-27\n\n                    Copyright 1996-2002, 2006 by\n          David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n============\n\n  The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;\n  some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,\n  various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the\n  FreeType Project.\n\n  This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and\n  which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license\n  affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,\n  documentation and makefiles, at the very least.\n\n  This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG\n  (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion\n  and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products\n  alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:\n\n    o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be\n      interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)\n\n    o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or\n      full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)\n\n    o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use\n      it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge\n      somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the\n      FreeType code. (`credits')\n\n  We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this\n  software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.\n  We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and\n  assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.\n\n\n  Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a\n  credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus\n  encourage you to use the following text:\n\n   \"\"\"\n    Portions of this software are copyright © <year> The FreeType\n    Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved.\n   \"\"\"\n\n  Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you\n  actually use.\n\n\nLegal Terms\n===========\n\n0. Definitions\n--------------\n\n  Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project',\n  and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally\n  distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and\n  Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,\n  beta or final release.\n\n  `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where\n  `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source\n  code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.\n  This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType\n  engine'.\n\n  This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original\n  FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and\n  documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its\n  original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.\n  If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by\n  this license, you must contact us to verify this.\n\n  The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner,\n  Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as\n  specified below.\n\n1. No Warranty\n--------------\n\n  THE FREETYPE PROJECT  IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT  WARRANTY OF ANY\n  KIND, EITHER  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO,\n  WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY   AND  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR\n  PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS\n  BE LIABLE  FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED  BY THE USE OR  THE INABILITY TO\n  USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.\n\n2. Redistribution\n-----------------\n\n  This  license  grants  a  worldwide, royalty-free,  perpetual  and\n  irrevocable right  and license to use,  execute, perform, compile,\n  display,  copy,   create  derivative  works   of,  distribute  and\n  sublicense the  FreeType Project (in  both source and  object code\n  forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and  to\n  authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted\n  herein, subject to the following conditions:\n\n    o Redistribution of  source code  must retain this  license file\n      (`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any  additions, deletions or changes to\n      the original  files must be clearly  indicated in accompanying\n      documentation.   The  copyright   notices  of  the  unaltered,\n      original  files must  be  preserved in  all  copies of  source\n      files.\n\n    o Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer  that\n      states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the\n      FreeType Team,  in  the  distribution  documentation.  We also\n      encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your\n      documentation, though this isn't mandatory.\n\n  These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on\n  the FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files.   If you use\n  our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no  fee need be paid\n  to us.\n\n3. Advertising\n--------------\n\n  Neither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use\n  the name of the  other for commercial, advertising, or promotional\n  purposes without specific prior written permission.\n\n  We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the\n  following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation\n  or advertising  materials: `FreeType Project',  `FreeType Engine',\n  `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.\n\n  As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to\n  accept  it.   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted\n  material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the\n  authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.\n  Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType\n  Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms\n  of this license.\n\n4.

Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Here\n    is a rough summary of which licenses apply to which parts of this\n    package (but check the individual files to be sure!):\n\n      - liblzma is in the public domain.\n\n      - xz, xzdec, and lzmadec command line tools are in the public\n        domain unless GNU getopt_long had to be compiled and linked\n        in from the lib directory. The getopt_long code is under\n        GNU LGPLv2.1+.\n\n      - The scripts to grep, diff, and view compressed files have been\n        adapted from gzip. These scripts and their documentation are\n        under GNU GPLv2+.\n\n      - All the documentation in the doc directory and most of the\n        XZ Utils specific documentation files in other directories\n        are in the public domain.\n\n      - Translated messages are in the public domain.\n\n      - The build system contains public domain files, and files that\n        are under GNU GPLv2+ or GNU GPLv3+. None of these files end up\n        in the binaries being built.\n\n      - Test files and test code in the tests directory, and debugging\n        utilities in the debug directory are in the public domain.\n\n      - The extra directory may contain public domain files, and files\n        that are under various free software licenses.\n\n    You can do whatever you want with the files that have been put into\n    the public domain. If you find public domain legally problematic,\n    take the previous sentence as a license grant. If you still find\n    the lack of copyright legally problematic, you have too many\n    lawyers.\n\n    As usual, this software is provided \"as is\", without any warranty.\n\n    If you copy significant amounts of public domain code from XZ Utils\n    into your project, acknowledging this somewhere in your software is\n    polite (especially if it is proprietary, non-free software), but\n    naturally it is not legally required. Here is an example of a good\n    notice to put into \"about box\" or into documentation:\n\n        This software includes code from XZ Utils <http://tukaani.org/xz/>.\n\n    The following license texts are included in the following files:\n      - COPYING.LGPLv2.1: GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1\n      - COPYING.GPLv2: GNU General Public License version 2\n      - COPYING.GPLv3: GNU General Public License version 3\n\n    Note that the toolchain (compiler, linker etc.) may add some code\n    pieces that are copyrighted. Thus, it is possible that e.g. liblzma\n    binary wouldn't actually be in the public domain in its entirety\n    even though it contains no copyrighted code from the XZ Utils source\n    package.\n\n    If you have questions, don't hesitate to ask the author(s) for more\n    information.\n\n\n----\n\nLIBPNG\n\nCOPYRIGHT NOTICE, DISCLAIMER, and LICENSE\n=========================================\n\nPNG Reference Library License version 2\n---------------------------------------\n\n * Copyright (c) 1995-2022 The PNG Reference Library Authors.\n * Copyright (c) 2018-2022 Cosmin Truta.\n * Copyright (c) 2000-2002, 2004, 2006-2018 Glenn Randers-Pehrson.\n * Copyright (c) 1996-1997 Andreas Dilger.\n * Copyright (c) 1995-1996 Guy Eric Schalnat, Group 42, Inc.\n\nThe software is supplied \"as is\", without warranty of any kind,\nexpress or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties\nof merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and\nnon-infringement.

Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE\n==========================\n\nPython was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting\nMathematisch Centrum (CWI, see https://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands\nas a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's\nprincipal author, although it includes many contributions from others.\n\nIn 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for\nNational Research Initiatives (CNRI, see https://www.cnri.reston.va.us)\nin Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the\nsoftware.\n\nIn May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to\nBeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same\nyear, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became\nZope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see\nhttps://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization\ncreated specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.\nZope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.\n\nAll Python releases are Open Source (see https://opensource.org for\nthe Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python\nreleases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes\nthe various releases.\n\n    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-\n                    from                                compatible?

All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute\n    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The\n    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with\n    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.\n\n(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,\n    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to\n    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1\n    is \"not incompatible\" with the GPL.\n\nThanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's\ndirection to make these releases possible.\n\n\nB.
